        I am a full-stack web developer focused on building modern, performant
        applications with Next.js, TypeScript, and React. I work confidently
        across both frontend and backend, and I enjoy crafting clean, responsive
        UIs using Tailwind CSS, ShadCN, and other tools from the modern React
        ecosystem. My background includes professional experience in tech, but
        over the past few years, I have dedicated myself to deepening my web
        development skills through hands-on projects and continuous learning. I
        have built applications that span from UI-rich frontend interfaces to
        fully integrated backend APIs—always with attention to detail,
        scalability, and user experience. Now, I’m actively seeking a role where
        I can contribute to a team building real-world products with Next.js,
        while continuing to grow as a developer in a modern JavaScript
        environment.
