      <p>Hi I am</p>
      <h1 class="text-4xl">Syed Urooj Kamal</h1>
      <h2 class="text-xl">A Web Developer</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Web Developer with expertise in <em>React</em> and
        <em>Tailwind CSS</em> and a solid understanding of cloud technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am good at problem-solving, and I love finding a performant or native
        way to solve my problems and showcasing my work.
      </p>
      <p>
        My strong suit is front-end development, where I focus on
        <em>responsive design</em> and high performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also have experience working with the backend with tools like
        Express.js and MongoDB to build full-stack applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to become a "10x developer", a developer that delivers highly
        efficient software within days. I believe code should not be unique for
        the sake of it, but rather as readable, maintainable, and easy to edit
        as possible.
